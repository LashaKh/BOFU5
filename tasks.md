- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Complexity Score:** 2/10
- **Issue:** All navigation and styling issues have been successfully resolved

### **🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **Dashboard Button Navigation Mismatch** - ✅ FIXED:
   - **Problem**: Main button navigated to `/user-dashboard` but route was `/dashboard`
   - **Solution**: Updated MainHeader.tsx button to navigate to `/dashboard`
   - **Result**: Dashboard button now works correctly

2. **Analyze Products Button Route Missing** - ✅ FIXED:
   - **Problem**: Button navigated to `/app` but route was `/research` 
   - **Solution**: Updated MainHeader.tsx button to navigate to `/research`
   - **Additional Fix**: Updated `/research` route to pass `isAppRoute=true` to `renderMainContent()`
   - **Result**: Analyze Products button now works correctly

3. **Generated Articles Button Navigation Issue** - ✅ FIXED:
   - **Problem**: Generated Articles button from dashboard redirected to home page
   - **Root Cause**: Navigation link pointed to `/dashboard/generated-article` (singular) but route was `/dashboard/generated-articles` (plural)
   - **Solution**: Updated UserDashboardSidebar.tsx navigation link to use correct plural route
   - **Result**: Generated Articles button now navigates correctly

4. **History Page Background Issue** - ✅ FIXED:
   - **Problem**: History page background was white instead of dark

   - **Solution**: Updated `/history` route in App.tsx to include dark gradient background and MainHeader
   - **Result**: History page now has proper dark background as expected

5. **Content Brief Edit Button Navigation** - ✅ FIXED:
   - **Investigation**: Content Brief edit button navigation was initially working from dashboard but not from Content Briefs page
   - **Problem Found**: Content Briefs page edit button used incorrect route format `/dashboard/content-briefs/${id}/edit`
   - **Correct Route**: `/dashboard/content-briefs/edit/${id}` as defined in App.tsx
   - **Solution**: Updated UserContentBriefs.tsx edit button navigation to use correct route format
   - **Result**: Content brief edit functionality now works correctly from both dashboard and Content Briefs page
