## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
The `product_documents` table now properly utilizes:
- `storage_path`: Path to file in Supabase Storage bucket
- `file_url`: Public URL for direct file access  
- `extracted_text`: Processed text content for preview
- `openai_vsf_id`: OpenAI vector store file ID for AI processing

### Storage Architecture
- **Bucket**: `product_documents`
- **File Structure**: `{user_id}/{product_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **Access Control**: Public read access with organized permissions
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup and conflict prevention

### React Component Architecture
- **DocumentPreviewModal.tsx**: Main modal component with full functionality
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing `DedicatedProductPage.tsx`
- **State Management**: Proper React hooks usage with no violations
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Fixed Issues

### üêõ **React Hooks Violation - RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error
- **Cause**: Conditional return statement placed between hook calls
- **Solution**: Moved all hooks before any conditional returns, restructured component flow
- **Result**: Clean React component with proper hook usage

### üìÅ **Missing File Storage - RESOLVED** ‚ú® *NEW*
- **Issue**: Documents uploaded but not stored in Supabase Storage
- **Cause**: File processing only extracted text, didn't save original files  
- **Solution**: Enhanced `handleDocumentsProcessed` with full Supabase Storage integration
- **Result**: Complete file upload, storage, and download functionality

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/product/DocumentPreviewModal.tsx`**
   - Complete modal component with all features
   - Keyboard shortcuts, status tracking, debug panels
   - Multi-download options and re-extraction capabilities

2. **`src/pages/DedicatedProductPage.tsx`**
   - Enhanced `handleDocumentsProcessed` with Supabase Storage
   - Proper file upload, URL generation, and database population
   - Integration with existing OpenAI processing workflow

3. **`DOCUMENT_PREVIEW_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`**
   - This comprehensive documentation file

## Testing & Verification

### To Test the Complete System:
1. **Upload Documents**: Use the document uploader with various file types
2. **Verify Storage**: Check Supabase Storage bucket for uploaded files  
3. **Test Downloads**: Use all download options in the preview modal
4. **Check Database**: Verify `storage_path` and `file_url` fields are populated
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Test Escape, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D functionality
6. **Error Handling**: Test with various file types and network conditions

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Files upload to Supabase Storage with organized naming
