# Product Context: BOFU AI

## 1. Why This Project Exists & Problems It Solves
B2B SaaS companies often struggle to consistently create high-quality, targeted Bottom-of-Funnel (BOFU) content that effectively converts leads into customers. This is due to several challenges:
- **Time & Resource Intensive:** Manually researching product details, competitive landscapes, and target audience pain points for each piece of BOFU content is incredibly time-consuming.
- **Inconsistent Messaging:** Without a centralized and data-driven approach, BOFU content can suffer from inconsistent messaging, value propositions, and calls-to-action across different assets and campaigns.
- **Lack of Personalization:** Generic BOFU content often fails to resonate with specific buyer personas or address their unique needs at the decision-making stage.
- **Sales & Marketing Misalignment:** Sales teams may lack the precise, compelling content they need for different sales scenarios, while marketing struggles to produce materials that directly support sales conversations.
- **Underutilized Product Knowledge:** Deep product knowledge and customer insights are often siloed within teams and not effectively translated into persuasive BOFU assets.

**BOFU AI aims to solve these problems by:**
- Automating the extraction and synthesis of relevant information to generate structured content briefs.
- Providing a user-friendly editor (`ContentBriefEditorNew`) to refine and manage these briefs, ensuring all necessary components for compelling BOFU content are considered.
- Ensuring a stable and clear display of brief information (`ContentBriefDisplay`) for easy consumption.
- Enabling the creation of data-driven, consistent, and highly targeted BOFU content at scale.
- Streamlining the workflow between product, marketing, and sales teams.

## 2. How It Should Work (Ideal User Experience)
- **Effortless Brief Creation:** Users (marketers, product managers) should be able to easily input core product information, target audience details, and competitive insights. The AI should then generate a comprehensive, well-structured content brief.
- **Intuitive Brief Editing & Management:** The `ContentBriefEditorNew` should allow users to intuitively review, edit, and enhance the AI-generated brief. This includes:
    - Easy inline editing of all text fields.
    - Simple management of lists (e.g., pain points, USPs, features, competitors) with clear add/edit/delete functionality in a grid or similar user-friendly layout.
    - Clear visualization of nested information.
    - Color-coding and icons to quickly identify different types of content within the brief.
    - Collapsible sections to manage information density.
    - Option for raw JSON editing for power users without compromising the primary visual editor.
- **Reliable Saving & Access:** Changes to briefs should be saved reliably (e.g., via Supabase integration), and users should be able to easily access and manage their library of content briefs.
- **Clear Brief Consumption:** Writers and content creators should be able to view the finalized content brief in a clean, easy-to-understand format (`ContentBriefDisplay`) that clearly outlines all requirements for the content piece.
- **Seamless Workflow:** The tool should feel like a natural part of the content creation workflow, reducing friction and manual data transfer.
