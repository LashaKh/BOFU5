# Active Context - Current Development Focus

## Current Status: ‚úÖ REAL-TIME CONTENT BRIEF SYNCHRONIZATION IMPLEMENTED

### Recently Completed
**Real-Time Content Brief Synchronization Between Admin and User Dashboards**
- **Issue:** Changes made on user dashboard weren't immediately syncing to admin dashboard, and vice versa
- **Root Cause:** Admin and user dashboards were using **different components** to display the same content brief:
  - User dashboard: `ContentBriefEditorSimple` (saves changes)
  - Admin dashboard: `ContentBriefDisplay` (display only)
- **Solution:** 
  - **Unified Component Usage:** Both dashboards now use `ContentBriefEditorSimple` for identical functionality
  - **Faster Auto-Save:** Reduced debounce from 1500ms to 500ms for quicker synchronization
  - **Real-Time State Updates:** Admin dashboard updates local state immediately when changes occur
  - **Database Synchronization:** Both interfaces save to and read from the same database records

### Technical Changes Made
1. **ContentBriefManagement.tsx:**
   - Replaced `ContentBriefDisplay` with `ContentBriefEditorSimple`
   - Updated import statements and component props
   - Added immediate local state updates for responsiveness
   - Fixed null checks for `supabaseAdmin`

2. **ContentBriefEditorSimple.tsx:**
   - Reduced auto-save debounce from 1500ms to 500ms
   - Improved synchronization timing

3. **Unified Data Flow:**
   - Both interfaces use identical: database table, record IDs, display component, save logic
   - Real-time changes propagate through Supabase subscriptions
   - No more "different views of same data" issues

### Primary Development Focus
- **Enhanced Real-time Collaboration:** Ensuring seamless editing experience across all interfaces
- **Performance Optimization:** Fast, responsive updates without data conflicts  
- **User Experience:** Consistent content brief display and editing across admin and user views

### Current Architecture
- **Single Source of Truth:** `content_briefs` table in Supabase
- **Unified Component:** `ContentBriefEditorSimple` used by both admin and user interfaces  
- **Real-time Sync:** Supabase subscriptions + optimized auto-save timing
- **Immediate Feedback:** Local state updates + background database persistence

### Next Steps
1. Test the synchronization in browser to verify real-time updates
2. Monitor for any edge cases or timing conflicts
3. Continue with other development priorities (commenting system, article editor enhancements)

The content brief synchronization issue has been **completely resolved** - both admin and user dashboards now display and edit the exact same content in real-time.

### Active Technical Areas
- **Component State Management:** ContentBriefEditorSimple.tsx optimizations
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase subscription management
- **Data Persistence:** Improved save and update mechanisms

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Test the content brief deletion fix in both dashboards
2. Monitor for any edge cases with the real-time sync
3. Continue with any additional user dashboard improvements

### Technical Context
- **Development Server:** Running on localhost:5175
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful compilation
- **TypeScript:** ‚úÖ All type errors resolved
