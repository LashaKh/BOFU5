## üö® **PREVIOUS CRITICAL ISSUE (RESOLVED):**

### **Keywords Race Condition Bug Fixed** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
After initial keywords corruption resolution, discovered and fixed a **severe race condition bug** where manual keyword saves were being overwritten by the auto-save mechanism, causing **complete data loss**.

**‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
**Manual Save Priority System:**
1. **Race Condition Prevention**: Added `isManualSaveInProgress` state flag to disable auto-save during manual keyword operations
2. **Immediate Manual Save**: Keywords now trigger immediate manual save via `onUpdateSection` instead of relying on auto-save
3. **Temporal Protection**: Auto-save disabled for 1 second after manual save to prevent interference
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with fallback re-enabling of auto-save

**üéØ FIX STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ **Race Condition Fixed**: Manual saves now have priority over auto-save
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity Protected**: Keywords won't be wiped out during save operations  
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper state recovery
- ‚úÖ **Performance Maintained**: Auto-save still works for other fields, only disabled temporarily for keywords
