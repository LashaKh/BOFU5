## Current Status: DEBUGGING COMPETITOR PERSISTENCE ISSUE üîç

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Current Task**: Using browser tools to debug competitor data persistence problem where competitors disappear on page refresh  
**Development Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:5175/

## üêõ **CURRENT ISSUE - COMPETITOR DATA PERSISTENCE (INVESTIGATION PHASE)**

### **Problem Description:**
Users can successfully identify competitors through the webhook integration, but the competitor data disappears when the page is refreshed. The logs show "Supabase update successful" but the data isn't persisting correctly.

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Initial Investigation**: The `fetchProductDetailsAndDocs` function had a flawed condition that only loaded analysis data if `companyName` existed
2. **Fixed Initial Issue**: Updated the condition to load analysis data even without `companyName`
3. **Problem Persists**: Despite the fix, competitors are still not persisting
4. **Current Debugging**: Using browser MCP tools to investigate the actual data flow

### **Debugging Steps Taken:**

#### **Added Comprehensive Logging:**
- Enhanced `fetchProductDetailsAndDocs` function with detailed logging to track what data is loaded from database
- Enhanced `handleProductSectionUpdate` function with specific competitor data logging
- Added logging to see the exact structure of data being saved to/loaded from database

#### **Code Changes Made:**
1. **fetchProductDetailsAndDocs fixes**: 
   - Removed `companyName` requirement for loading analysis data
   - Added detailed logging for database load process
   - Added specific competitor data checks

2. **handleProductSectionUpdate improvements**:
   - Added competitor-specific debugging
   - Simplified data flow to ensure proper JSON serialization
   - Added verification of data structure before saving

#### **Browser Investigation Findings:**
- Screenshot shows competitors displaying as "0 items: Array(0)" for all three categories
- Console logs cleared and monitoring real-time during competitor identification
- Need to trigger competitor identification to see the complete data flow

### **Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Use browser tools to monitor competitor identification process in real-time
2. ‚è≥ Trigger competitor identification and capture all console logs
3. ‚è≥ Analyze the complete data flow from webhook ‚Üí component ‚Üí database ‚Üí reload
4. ‚è≥ Identify where in the chain the data is being lost
5. ‚è≥ Implement targeted fix based on findings

### **Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/DedicatedProductPage.tsx` - Enhanced logging and fixed loading conditions
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Tracking progress

### **Current Investigation Status:**
- Browser tools connected and monitoring
- Enhanced logging deployed
- Ready to trigger competitor identification test
- Focusing on data flow analysis to identify exact failure point
