# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Review, refinement, and potential finalization of the `ContentBriefEditorNew.fixed.tsx` component.
- Ensuring overall stability and user experience of content brief features following recent major implementations and bug fixes.

## Recent Changes
- **Content Brief Editor UI (`ContentBriefEditorNew.tsx` and `ContentBriefEditorNew.fixed.tsx`):**
    - A new, modern, card-based editor (`ContentBriefEditorNew.tsx`) was developed for content briefs.
    - Key Features: Collapsible sections, custom color coding, full inline editing, specialized UI for array data types (Pain Points, USPs, etc.) with grid layouts, nested object support, raw JSON editing option, and direct Supabase integration.
    - Technologies: React with TypeScript, framer-motion for animations, Lucide-react for icons, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
    - Successfully integrated into the `EditContentBrief` page.
    - Current attention is on `ContentBriefEditorNew.fixed.tsx`, possibly addressing further refinements or fixes based on the original implementation.
- **`ContentBriefDisplay.tsx` Bug Fix:**
    - Resolved a critical infinite update loop that was causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.
    - The root cause was identified as state updates within `updateContent()` which improperly triggered a cycle of parent `onContentChange` callbacks and component re-renders.
    - The solution involved separating state updates from content synchronization logic, primarily by moving `updateContent` calls to a dedicated `useEffect` hook that runs specifically when section data changes, and adding conditions to prevent unnecessary updates, particularly on initial render.

## Next Steps
- (User to define specific next tasks, e.g., further testing of `ContentBriefEditorNew.fixed.tsx`, addressing new feature requests, or moving to other parts of the application).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritizing a high-quality, intuitive user interface for content brief management.
- Focusing on robust state management patterns in React to prevent bugs like the one fixed in `ContentBriefDisplay.tsx`.
- Ensuring new components are well-integrated and performant.
